# mp-haskell7-world
a port overlay that resurrects the haskell7 infrastructure for macports

This repository is primarily of interest for those users of MacPorts on systems that are not new enough to install and run the version 8.x haskell setup in the current MacPorts.

To use it, clone this repo to your hard drive somewhere, then edit your macports sources.conf file, and add it as a local repository above your main macports repository.

It is not heavily tested, but it is sufficient to install ghc, a number of haskell supporting bits, and pandoc.

I hope this of use to someone, but it obviously comes with no warranty of any kind.
